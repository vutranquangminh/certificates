# 🎓 CS50 – Introduction to Programming with Scratch

This repository highlights my successful completion of **CS50’s Introduction to Programming with Scratch**, a beginner-level computer science course offered by **Harvard University** through edX/OpenCourseWare.

## 🧠 Course Overview

CS50 Scratch is a visual, block-based introduction to programming, developed by the Lifelong Kindergarten group at MIT’s Media Lab. It is used as the initial entry point to Harvard’s broader CS50 curriculum. The course is self-paced and typically completed in about 3 weeks, requiring 2–6 hours per week.

Students progress through nine modules, culminating in a final project that integrates all core concepts.

## 🎯 What I Learned

By completing all modules and the final project, I gained a strong foundation in:

- **Sprites & Visual Interface** – Creating and animating Scratch characters  
- **Events** – Programming interactivity through user input  
- **Functions (My Blocks)** – Structuring reusable code  
- **Values & Variables** – Managing and updating program data  
- **Conditions** – Using logical flow control (`if–then–else`)  
- **Loops** – Automating repetitive actions  
- **Abstraction** – Modularizing logic for clarity and reuse  
- **Final Project** – Designing a fully functional Scratch application

These skills provide a solid introduction to computational thinking and are transferable to traditional languages like Python, Java, and C.

## 📈 Why It Matters

- **Beginner-Friendly**: No prior programming experience required  
- **Concept-Focused**: Strong emphasis on logic and structure  
- **Globally Recognized**: Part of Harvard’s prestigious CS50 series

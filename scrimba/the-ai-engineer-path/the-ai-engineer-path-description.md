## 🧠 Course Overview

The AI Engineer Path is a project-based program crafted for intermediate to advanced developers looking to integrate AI into their applications. It emphasizes prompt engineering, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), embeddings, vector databases, and AI assistant agents.

**Duration**: ~10 hours (self-paced)  
**Technologies**: JavaScript, OpenAI API (GPT-4, DALL·E 3), LangChain.js, Hugging Face, Supabase, Cloudflare Workers, Assistants API  
**Final Requirement**: Build AI-powered apps through 100+ interactive lessons and practical solo projects

## 🎯 What I Learned

Through interactive scrims and projects, I gained practical experience with:

- **Prompt Engineering** – Designing effective prompts for language models  
- **OpenAI API (GPT-4)** – Text generation, function calling, GPT Vision  
- **DALL·E 3** – Generating images via API  
- **LangChain.js & Hugging Face** – Integrating and chaining model capabilities  
- **Embeddings & RAG** – Creating knowledge retrieval pipelines with Supabase  
- **AI Assistants** – Building agents using ReAct, Assistants API, and custom tools  
- **Deployment** – Using Cloudflare Workers & Pages for production-ready hosting

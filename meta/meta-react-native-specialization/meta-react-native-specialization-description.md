## 🏁 Reflection

Completing this specialization helped me deepen my understanding of mobile development in a practical and structured way. The capstone project allowed me to integrate UI/UX principles with real-time data and complex logic in a native-like mobile environment. I now feel confident in building and deploying cross-platform mobile apps using the React Native ecosystem—and I'm excited to continue applying these skills in real-world projects.

## 🏁 Reflection

This specialization strengthened my grasp of **component-based development** and reactive programming in the browser. By building apps with reusable components, managing application state, and introducing testing early on, I’ve developed a solid foundation in frontend development. I now feel more confident building fast, interactive UIs with React—and I'm excited to continue advancing toward full-stack proficiency.
